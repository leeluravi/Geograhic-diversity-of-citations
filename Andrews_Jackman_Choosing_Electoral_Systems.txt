Abstract 


We 
compare 
patterns 
of 
electoral 
rule 
choice 
in 
two 
periods, 
that 
following 
the 
First 
World 
War 
in 
Western 
Europe 
and 
that 
following 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Cold 
War 
in 
Central 
and 
Eastern 
Europe. 
Heretofore, 
scholars 
have 
studied 
these 
two 
instances 
of 
electoral 
rule 
choice 
separately 
and 
have 
come 
to 
quite 
different 
conclusions 
about 
the 
implications 
of 
strategic 
behavior 
of 
the 
relevant 
actors. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
early 
20th 
Century 
Western 
Europe, 
Rokkan 
and 
later 
Boix 
cast 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
rules 
as 
a 
result 
of 
coordinated 
strategic 
behavior 
by 
established 
parties 
in 
reaction 
to 
increasing 
support 
for 
new 
parties 
of 
the 
left. 
In 
contrast, 
recent 
analyses 
of 
the 
post-
Cold 
War 
period 
in 
Central 
and 
Eastern 
Europe 
suggest 
that 
while 
all 
political 
actors 
acted 
strategically, 
an 
extreme 
lack 
of 
information 
prevented 
them 
from 
making 
choices 
that 
served 
their 
self-interest 
in 
the 
long 
run. 
Indeed, 
many 
party 
leaders 
supported 
electoral 
rules 
that 
later 
eliminated 
them 
from 
politics. 
We 
argue 
that 
uncertainty 
was 
a 
major 
factor 
in 
both 
periods 
of 
electoral 
rule 
design, 
so 
that 
political 
elites 
often 
made 
serious 
miscalculations 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
particular 
electoral 
rules 
on 
their 
own 
future 
success. 
A 
reanalysis 
of 
the 
Boix 
data 
suggests 
that 
efforts 
to 
explain 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
rules 
as 
a 
coordinated 
response 
by 
established 
parties 
to 
electoral 
threat 
must 
be 
viewed 
with 
skepticism, 
since 
uncertainty 
made 
success 
or 
failure 
almost 
impossible 
to 
predict. 
Instead, 
any 
strategic 
behavior 
was 
short-term 
at 
best, 
reflecting 
the 
largest 
party’s 
most 
recent 
experience 
in 
the 
preceding 
election.

Introduction 
The 
recent 
wave 
of 
democratization 
in 
Central 
and 
Eastern 
Europe 
has 
refocused 
attention 
on 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
institutions. 
The 
emerging 
view 
takes 
this 
choice 
to 
be 
the 
product 
of 
strategic 
decisions 
by 
key 
political 
actors 
operating 
under 
uncertainty 
(Przeworski, 
1991; 
Lijphart, 
1992; 
Geddes, 
1996; 
Shvetsova, 
2003). 
In 
contrast, 
research 
on 
the 
electoral 
reforms 
that 
occurred 
in 
Western 
Europe 
surrounding 
the 
First 
World 
War 
has 
cast 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
institutions 
as 
the 
predictable 
product 
of 
strategic 
calculations 
of 
established 
parties 
given 
the 
vote 
received 
by 
rising 
socialist 
forces 
(for 
the 
classic 
statement, 
see 
Rokkan, 
1970, 
and 
for 
a 
recent 
statement, 
see 
Boix, 
1999). 
Among 
other 
things, 
this 
predictability 
implies 
that 
strategic 
calculations 
underlying 
electoral 
choices 
in 
the 
early 
20th 
Century 
involved 
little 
uncertainty 
about 
the 
political 
consequences 
of 
alternative 
institutional 
arrangements. 


Our 
purpose 
is 
to 
show 
that 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
systems 
in 
the 
two 
periods 
was 
governed 
by 
the 
same 
logic, 
one 
in 
which 
strategic 
actors 
sought 
to 
maximize 
their 
legislative 
presence 
under 
conditions 
of 
extreme 
uncertainty. 
Given 
this 
fact, 
the 
safest 
choice 
typically 
involved 
some 
form 
of 
proportional 
representation. 
Further, 
political 
actors 
have 
had 
mixed 
success 
at 
best 
in 
choosing 
electoral 
rules 
that 
subsequently 
optimized 
their 
electoral 
performance. 
In 
many 
cases, 
particular 
parties 
appear 
(at 
least 
in 
retrospect) 
to 
have 
been 
strategically 
foolish, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
the 
rules 
they 
approved 
ended 
up 
eliminating 
them 
from 
politics. 


2. 
The 
issues 
Like 
institutional 
change 
more 
generally, 
electoral 
reform 
is 
a 
rare 
event, 
since 
those 
in 
a 
position 
to 
initiate 
reform 
themselves 
assumed 
power 
under 
existing 
institutional 
arrangements 
(see, 
e.g. 
Cox, 
1997, 
p. 
18). 
For 
political 
actors 
to 
engage 
in 
reform 
of 
the 
procedures 
by 
which 
they 
won 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
they 
must 
come 
to 
believe 
either 
that 
existing 
arrangements 
will 
adversely 
affect 
their 
future 
prospects 
for 
winning, 
or 
that 
they 
face 
considerable 
uncertainty, 
or 
both. 
This, 
in 
turn, 
is 
most 
likely 
when 
winners 
face 
a 
profound 
shift 
in 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
electorate 
and/or 
the 
political 
arena 
more 
broadly 
arising 
from 
major 
political 
transformations. 
Just 
as 
events 
in 
Central 
and 
Eastern 
Europe 
in 
the 
late 
20th 
Century 
constituted 
a 
major 
transformation, 
so 
too 
did 
the 
events 
surrounding 
the 
First 
World 
War 
in 
much 
of 
Western 
Europe. 
Such 
transformations 
are 
by 
definition 
extraordinary, 
and 
uncertainty 
becomes 
endemic 
for 
all 
actors. 


3. 
Studies 
of 
the 
recent 
period 
Studies 
of 
the 
adoption 
of 
electoral 
rules 
in 
post-communist 
Central 
and 
Eastern 
Europe 
emphasize 
the 
ways 
that 
uncertainty 
undermines 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
strategic 
behavior 
of 
all 
parties 
(see, 
e.g. 
Remington 
and 
Smith, 
1996; 
Moraski 
and 



J.T. 
Andrews, 
R.W. 
Jackman 
/ 
Electoral 
Studies

Loewenberg, 
1999; 
Moser, 
2001; 
Kaminski, 
2002; 
Shvetsova, 
2003). 
All 
actors, 
whether 
favoring 
the 
status 
quo 
or 
not, 
support 
electoral 
rules 
that 
they 
believe 
will 
optimize 
their 
legislative 
presence 
(see, 
e.g. 
Benoit, 
2004). 
However, 
miscalculations 
are 
frequent, 
if 
not 
the 
norm, 
given 
informational 
shortcomings. 


Typically, 
in 
the 
recently 
formed 
democracies 
of 
Central 
and 
Eastern 
Europe, 
new 
electoral 
rules 
were 
first 
negotiated 
in 
round 
table 
settings 
that 
included 
political 
parties 
present 
during 
the 
time 
of 
transition 
(Geddes, 
1996; 
Elster 
et 
al., 
1998). 
Newly 
elected 
legislatures 
often 
further 
amended, 
or 
changed 
outright, 
these 
initial 
choices. 
In 
analyzing 
the 
strategic 
interests 
and 
preferences 
of 
parties 
at 
either 
the 
round 
table 
negotiations 
or 
in 
legislative 
decision-making, 
scholars 
have 
stressed 
the 
discrepancies 
between 
anticipated 
and 
realized 
consequences 
of 
particular 
rules. 
Among 
other 
things, 
the 
post-communist 
transitions 
involved 
substantial 
volatility 
in 
partisan 
electoral 
support 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
number 
and 
ideological 
characteristics 
of 
political 
parties. 
Further, 
opinion 
polls 
revealed 
dramatic 
and 
frequent 
shifts 
in 
public 
support 
for 
political 
parties, 
and 
key 
political 
actors 
had 
limited 
historical 
electoral 
experience 
on 
which 
to 
base 
their 
calculations. 
All 
these 
factors 
increased 
the 
odds 
of 
strategic 
mistakes, 
and 
the 
‘‘evidence 
systematically 
shows 
that 
. 
post-
communist 
institution-makers 
adopted 
the 
rules 
that 
they 
themselves 
would 
have 
wanted 
to 
change 
almost 
immediately’’ 
(Shvetsova, 
2003, 
p. 
201). 


Analyses 
of 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
rules 
in 
post-communist 
countries 
underscore 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
the 
quality 
of 
strategic 
decisions 
hinges 
on 
the 
information 
available 
to 
the 
key 
actors 
at 
the 
time 
(Shvetsova, 
2003, 
pp. 
193–194). 
In 
Kaminski’s 
words, 
‘‘There 
are 
two 
reasons 
that 
may 
explain 
a 
disastrous 
outcome 
for 
a 
rational 
player 
or 
a 
stunning 
success 
for 
a 
fool. 
First, 
the 
model 
used 
by 
a 
player 
may 
be 
inadequate 
for 
the 
empirical 
decision 
problem.. 
Second, 
when 
uncertainty 
is 
involved, 
a 
surprising 
‘move 
of 
Nature’ 
may 
turn 
a 
smart 
decision 
into 
a 
bad 
outcome 
or 
a 
stupid 
decision 
into 
a 
glorious 
victory’’ 
(2002, 
p. 
334). 
Consider 
the 
effect 
of 
uncertainty 
over 
three 
essential 
kinds 
of 
information 
needed 
to 
predict 
the 
potential 
effect 
of 
electoral 
rules 
on 
electoral 
outcomes. 
These 
are: 
(1) 
the 
number 
of 
parties 
that 
will 
compete 
in 
future 
elections; 
(2) 
the 
preferences 
of 
voters 
over 
these 
parties; 
and 
(3) 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
electoral 
rules 
themselves, 
especially 
institutional 
details 
such 
as 
the 
district 
magnitude 
or 
electoral 
threshold. 
Observe 
the 
interdependencies 
among 
these 
three 
types 
of 
information. 
For 
example, 
unless 
actors 
know 
the 
number 
of 
parties 
that 
will 
compete 
in 
future 
elections, 
they 
cannot 
gauge 
voter 
preferences. 
Similarly, 
absent 
information 
about 
voter 
preferences, 
they 
cannot 
calculate 
the 
effect 
that 
the 
electoral 
rules 
will 
have 
on 
electoral 
results, 
even 
if 
they 
are 
knowledgeable 
about 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
particular 
set 
of 
rules 
on 
election 
outcomes. 
Thus, 
uncertainty 
over 
any 
of 
these 
three 
particular 
types 
of 
information 
leads 
to 
more 
generalized 
uncertainty 
over 
the 
relationship 
between 
electoral 
rules 
and 
electoral 
outcomes. 


The 
interdependencies 
between 
these 
three 
types 
of 
information 
mean 
that 
actors 
face 
considerable 
uncertainty 
even 
if 
they 
are 
quite 
well-informed 
on 
two 
of 
the 
three 
counts 
(as 
is 
more 
likely 
in 
contemporary 
well-established 
democracies). 
For 
example, 
a 
change 
in 
electoral 
rules 
may 
lead 
to 
the 
entry 
of 
new 
parties 
or 
the 
demise 
of 
old 
ones. 
That 
is, 
the 
choice 
of 
rules 
influences 
the 
number 
of 
parties, 
which 
in 
turn 
changes 
voter 
preferences 
and 
electoral 
results. 
In 
addition, 
while 
polling 
results 
may 



J.T. 
Andrews, 
R.W. 
Jackman 
/ 
Electoral 
Studies

(2005) 
65–84 
be 
accurate 
on 
a 
certain 
day 
given 
a 
certain 
set 
of 
parties, 
if 
the 
set 
of 
parties 
changes, 
so 
too 
do 
voter 
preferences. 
Finally, 
beyond 
a 
general 
understanding 
of 
the 
different 
effects 
of 
proportional 
representation 
(PR) 
versus 
single-member 
district 
plurality 
(SMDP), 
even 
experts’ 
understanding 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
complex 
electoral 
rules 
on 
electoral 
outcomes 
is 
quite 
limited, 
and 
the 
politicians 
designing 
post-communist 
electoral 
systems 
were 
simply 
not 
aware 
of 
the 
important 
effects 
of 
features 
such 
as 
the 
electoral 
threshold 
and 
district 
magnitude 
(Remington 
and 
Smith, 
1996, 
pp. 
1259– 
1261; 
Shvetsova, 
2003, 
pp. 
203–206). 
Thus, 
given 
the 
conditional 
impact 
of 
each 
separate 
source 
of 
uncertainty 
along 
with 
the 
general 
limitations 
of 
expert 
understanding 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
electoral 
rules, 
uncertainty 
always 
plagues 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
rules. 
It 
follows 
that 
there 
can 
be 
no 
simple 
linear 
relationship 
between 
electoral 
rule 
choice 
and 
electoral 
performance. 


This 
is 
not 
to 
imply 
that 
political 
actors 
do 
not 
behave 
strategically; 
in 
fact, 
they 
do 
so 
to 
the 
best 
of 
their 
ability. 
As 
has 
often 
been 
observed 
(e.g. 
Geddes, 
1996; 
Benoit, 
2004), 
political 
parties 
in 
the 
late 
20th 
Century, 
whether 
status 
quo 
communists 
or 
new 
opposition 
parties, 
supported 
electoral 
rules 
that 
they 
believed 
were 
best 
for 
them. 
Unfortunately, 
uncertainty 
made 
it 
impossible 
for 
any 
political 
actor 
to 
predict 
how 
particular 
electoral 
designs 
would 
affect 
party 
support. 
Remington 
and 
Smith 
tell 
us 
that 
the 
political 
actors 
responsible 
for 
writing 
Russia’s 
electoral 
law 
were 
themselves 
well-aware 
of 
this 
uncertainty. 
‘‘As 
best 
we 
can 
determine, 
then, 
calculating 
politicians 
struggled 
with 
what 
they 
realized 
was 
inadequate 
information 
for 
making 
the 
choices 
they 
faced’’ 
(1996, 
p. 
1261). 
It 
is 
not 
hard 
to 
find 
examples 
from 
the 
recent 
experience 
in 
Eastern 
Europe 
of 
the 
three 
types 
of 
uncertainty 
reviewed 
above: 
(1) 
uncertainty 
over 
the 
number 
of 
political 
parties; 
(2) 
uncertainty 
over 
the 
preferences 
of 
voters; 
and 


(3) 
uncertainty 
over 
the 
impact 
of 
electoral 
rules. 
3.1. 
Uncertainty 
over 
the 
number 
of 
political 
parties 
In 
every 
new 
post-communist 
democracy, 
political 
actors 
were 
unable 
to 
predict 
how 
many 
parties 
would 
compete 
in 
the 
first 
elections. 
In 
Poland, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
severe 
cases 
of 
such 
uncertainty, 
parties 
other 
than 
the 
former 
communist 
party 
did 
not 
exist 
prior 
to 
the 
first 
election, 
and 
the 
number 
and 
even 
names 
of 
many 
of 
the 
tens 
of 
political 
parties 
that 
competed 
in 
the 
first 
election 
were 
not 
known 
until 
the 
October 
1991 
election 
itself. 
In 
Russia, 
where 
the 
number 
of 
parties 
that 
competed 
in 
the 
party 
list 
contest 
was 
only 
thirteen, 
the 
final 
determination 
of 
those 
parties 
that 
would, 
in 
fact, 
compete 
was 
not 
made 
until 
November, 
1993, 
just 
1 
month 
before 
the 
election 
itself 
(White 
et 
al., 
1997). 
In 
Hungary, 
where 
nine 
political 
parties 
existed 
prior 
to 
the 
first 
competitive 
election, 
there 
was 
a 
degree 
of 
predictability 
lacking 
in 
Poland 
and 
Russia; 
nevertheless, 
several 
additional 
parties 
joined 
these 
in 
competing 
for 
seats 
in 
the 
1990 
election. 


3.2. 
Uncertainty 
over 
the 
preferences 
of 
voters 
Party 
leaders 
had 
little 
reliable 
information 
about 
the 
preferences 
of 
voters. 
Although 
public 
opinion 
polls 
were 
taken 
in 
some 
countries, 
the 
results 
of 
these 
polls

were 
notoriously 
inaccurate. 
Because 
the 
field 
of 
parties 
competing 
was 
in 
constant 
flux, 
polls 
could 
not 
be 
accurate. 
But, 
the 
most 
serious 
source 
of 
inaccuracy 
was 
the 
volatility 
of 
voters’ 
opinions. 
In 
one 
of 
the 
best 
surveys 
of 
voter 
opinion 
in 
post-
communist 
elections, 
Colton 
(2000) 
records 
extraordinary 
shifts 
in 
voter 
preferences 
over 
the 
course 
of 
several 
weeks 
leading 
up 
to 
the 
1995 
parliamentary 
and 
1996 
presidential 
elections 
in 
Russia. 
The 
acute 
shifts 
in 
voters’ 
choices 
between 
former 
communist 
parties 
and 
new 
right-reformist 
parties 
from 
election 
to 
election 
in 
many 
of 
the 
post-communist 
countries 
attests 
to 
the 
continuing 
lack 
of 
voter 
identification 
with 
particular 
parties 
or 
even 
ideologies. 


3.3. 
Uncertainty 
over 
the 
impact 
of 
electoral 
rules 
In 
dramatic 
support 
of 
the 
assertion 
that 
under 
conditions 
of 
uncertainty, 
political 
actors 
have 
difficulty 
predicting 
the 
outcomes 
of 
different 
institutional 
arrangements 
(Przeworski, 
1991, 
p. 
85), 
there 
were 
political 
parties 
in 
all 
post-
communist 
countries 
that 
supported 
electoral 
rules 
that 
eliminated 
them 
from 
politics 
(Shvetsova, 
2003). 


4. 
Electoral 
choice 
and 
uncertainty 
Given 
a 
high 
level 
of 
uncertainty, 
it 
is 
rational 
for 
parties 
to 
prefer 
an 
electoral 
system 
that 
best 
ensures 
their 
future 
survival. 
Scholars 
have 
suggested 
that 
proportional 
representation 
is 
a 
safer 
choice 
for 
a 
party 
that 
is 
not 
certain 
what 
share 
of 
the 
vote 
it 
will 
receive, 
especially 
if 
it 
is 
unsure 
whether 
it 
can 
win 
a 
plurality 
of 
the 
vote 
(Przeworski, 
1991; 
Lijphart, 
1992; 
Geddes, 
1996). 
Empirically, 
we 
know 
that 
proportional 
electoral 
systems 
encourage 
more 
parties 
than 
do 
single 
member 
district 
plurality 
systems 
(Duverger, 
1954; 
Lijphart, 
1994; 
Cox, 
1997). 


Shvetsova 
models 
formally 
the 
effect 
of 
uncertainty 
on 
electoral 
rule 
choice 
(2003, 
pp. 
194–199). 
In 
her 
model, 
three 
states 
of 
the 
world 
are 
possible: 
(1) 
one 
in 
which 
no 
third 
party 
can 
succeed; 
(2) 
one 
in 
which 
only 
one 
new 
party 
can 
succeed; 
and 
(3) 
one 
in 
which 
several 
new 
competitors 
can 
succeed. 
Depending 
on 
the 
actors’ 
assessments 
of 
the 
probability 
of 
each 
of 
these 
states 
of 
the 
world 
occurring, 
the 
‘rational’ 
choice 
of 
electoral 
system 
engineers 
will 
be 
either 
PR, 
SMDP, 
or 
a 
compromise 
system 
that 
includes 
both 
PR 
and 
SMDP, 
a 
so-called 
mixed 
system. 
Her 
model 
predicts 
that 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
scenarios, 
actors 
will 
choose 
either 
PR 
or 
a 
mixed 
electoral 
system 
involving 
both 
proportional 
and 
single 
member 
district 
components 
(Shvetsova, 
2003, 
Fig. 
5). 


This 
may 
help 
explain 
why 
only 
a 
small 
minority 
of 
the 
world’s 
democracies 
employ 
single 
member 
district 
electoral 
systems. 
As 
Cox 
(1997, 
Table 
3.2) 
shows, 
of 
the 
52 
democracies 
with 
populations 
of 
more 
than 
one 
million 
in 
1990, 
just 
one-
fourth 
elect 
their 
national 
representatives 
exclusively 
in 
single 
member 
districts. 
About 
three-fourths 
of 
the 
world’s 
democracies 
elect 
their 
national 
representatives 
from 
multi-member 
districts, 
using 
either 
some 
version 
of 
proportional 
representation, 
a 
mixed 
system 
in 
which 
lists 
are 
used 
to 
ensure 
a 
more 
proportional 
result, 
or

an 
alternative 
multi-member 
district 
system. 
Among 
the 
new 
democracies 
that 
have 
emerged 
(or 
re-emerged) 
in 
the 
past 
15 
years, 
none 
has 
adopted 
a 
single 
member 
district 
electoral 
system 
unless 
it 
has 
done 
so 
as 
part 
of 
a 
mixed 
system. 
That 
the 
electoral 
system 
of 
choice 
for 
most 
of 
the 
world’s 
democracies 
involves 
some 
form 
of 
proportional 
representation 
provides 
compelling 
evidence 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
uncertainty 
on 
electoral 
choice. 


Given 
this, 
the 
almost 
universal 
choice 
of 
some 
form 
of 
proportional 
representation 
in 
those 
democracies 
in 
which 
electoral 
reform 
was 
seriously 
entertained 
in 
the 
years 
surrounding 
the 
First 
World 
War 
is 
unlikely 
to 
represent 
an 
informed 
response 
by 
established 
parties. 
It 
is 
instead 
more 
profitably 
cast 
as 
the 
best 
choice 
of 
all 
parties 
operating 
under 
uncertainty. 
We 
turn 
now 
to 
the 
standard 
account 
of 
electoral 
choice 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
20th 
Century. 


5. 
Studies 
of 
the 
early 
period 
As 
we 
have 
already 
observed, 
in 
his 
influential 
analysis 
of 
the 
choices 
of 
electoral 
rules 
in 
early 
20th 
Century 
Western 
Europe, 
Rokkan 
also 
emphasized 
the 
strategic 
concerns 
generated 
by 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
suffrage 
and 
appearance 
of 
new 
parties 
of 
the 
left. 
‘‘The 
rising 
working 
class 
wanted 
to 
lower 
the 
thresholds 
of 
representation 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
access 
to 
the 
legislatures, 
and 
the 
most 
threatened 
of 
the 
old-established 
parties 
demanded 
PR 
to 
protect 
their 
position 
against 
the 
new 
waves 
of 
mobilized 
voters 
created 
by 
universal 
suffrage’’ 
(Rokkan, 
1970, 
p. 
157). 
According 
to 
Rokkan, 
as 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
electorate 
that 
supported 
the 
established 
parties 
decreased, 
those 
parties 
became 
more 
likely 
to 
support 
a 
reformed 
electoral 
system 
that 
would 
ensure 
their 
future 
survival. 
Thus, 
proportional 
representation 
was 
adopted 
because 
it 
was 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
established 
political 
actors 
to 
do 
so. 


Building 
on 
Rokkan’s 
work, 
Boix 
(1999) 
has 
analyzed 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
systems 
in 
the 
set 
of 
countries 
that 
experienced 
at 
least 
a 
period 
of 
democratic 
government 
during 
the 
interwar 
years 
(1919–1939) 
after 
the 
general 
introduction 
of 
adult 
suffrage. 
In 
the 
principal 
part 
of 
his 
analysis, 
he 
characterizes 
the 
strategic 
calculations 
of 
party 
leaders 
as 
follows: 


As 
the 
electoral 
arena 
changes 
(due 
to 
the 
entry 
of 
new 
voters 
or 
a 
change 
in 
voters’ 
preferences), 
the 
ruling 
parties 
modify 
the 
electoral 
system, 
depending 
on 
the 
emergence 
of 
new 
parties 
and 
the 
coordinating 
capacities 
of 
the 
old 
parties. 
When 
the 
new 
parties 
are 
strong, 
the 
old 
parties 
shift 
from 
plurality/majority 
to 
proportional 
representation 
if 
no 
old 
party 
enjoys 
a 
dominant 
position, 
but 
they 
do 
not 
do 
this 
if 
there 
is 
a 
dominant 
old 
party. 
When 
new 
entrants 
are 
weak, 
a 
system 
of 
non-proportional 
representation 
is 
maintained, 
regardless 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
old 
party 
system 
(Boix, 
1999, 
p. 
609). 


Change 
in 
electoral 
rules 
is 
cast 
as 
a 
strategic 
response 
by 
established 
elites 
to 
the 
changing 
political 
arena. 
According 
to 
this 
argument, 
established 
parties 
favored 
the 
status 
quo 
until 
events 
convinced 
them 
that 
existing 
electoral 
laws 
allowed 
a 
new 
challenger 
to 
displace 
them, 
at 
which 
point 
they 
moved 
preemptively 
to 
support

65–84 
a 
reformed 
electoral 
regime 
to 
minimize 
their 
political 
losses. 
In 
this 
view, 
established 
parties 
acted 
strategically 
– 
coordinating 
their 
actions 
when 
necessary 
– 
to 
maximize 
or 
preserve 
their 
legislative 
strength 
in 
light 
of 
significant 
changes 
to 
the 
distribution 
of 
preferences 
and 
number 
of 
political 
parties. 


The 
argument 
is 
appealing 
in 
that 
it 
appears 
to 
identify 
the 
appropriate 
decision-
makers 
as 
well 
as 
to 
provide 
a 
consistent 
and 
rational 
explanation 
of 
variation 
in 
choice 
of 
electoral 
rules. 
When 
established 
party 
leaders 
judge 
their 
hold 
on 
majority 
support 
to 
be 
waning, 
they 
wisely 
select 
proportional 
representation. 
If 
they 
believe 
their 
hold 
on 
majority 
support 
is 
not 
threatened, 
they 
maintain 
a 
single 
member 
district 
system. 


But 
this 
account 
of 
electoral 
choice 
as 
a 
predictable 
function 
of 
elite 
behavior 
hinges 
on 
two 
tacit 
assumptions. 
First, 
and 
most 
notably, 
it 
presumes 
that 
those 
elites 
possessed 
sufficient 
information 
to 
be 
able 
to 
gauge 
accurately 
future 
voter 
preferences 
and 
the 
number 
of 
political 
parties. 
The 
role 
of 
uncertainty 
in 
the 
strategic 
calculations 
of 
party 
leaders 
is 
completely 
discounted. 
Second, 
the 
explanation 
implicitly 
assumes 
that 
political 
elites 
at 
the 
time 
operated 
in 
a 
Duverger-style 
environment, 
where 
the 
choices 
were 
between 
a 
form 
of 
SMDP 
rule 
and 
some 
form 
of 
PR. 
However, 
the 
status 
quo 
in 
continental 
Europe 
before 
the 
First 
World 
War 
involved 
majority 
rather 
than 
plurality 
rules, 
typically 
with 
provisions 
for 
runoff 
elections. 


With 
the 
benefit 
of 
hindsight, 
the 
consequences 
of 
electoral 
reform 
in 
the 
early 
part 
of 
the 
20th 
Century 
may 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
preordained. 
However, 
as 
we 
have 
already 
emphasized, 
the 
political 
events 
surrounding 
the 
First 
World 
War 
culminating 
in 
full 
adult 
suffrage 
constituted 
a 
major 
political 
transformation, 
and 
we 
should 
not 
minimize 
the 
uncertainty 
this 
transformation 
generated 
for 
the 
key 
political 
actors 
at 
the 
time. 


Consider 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
suffrage. 
Between 
1900 
and 
1925, 
the 
size 
of 
the 
electorate 
doubled 
or 
trebled 
in 
nine 
major 
European 
sovereign 
states 
(Bartolini, 
2000, 
pp. 
216–217, 
584–588).1 
As 
shown 
in 
Fig. 
1, 
in 
all 
but 
one 
of 
these 
cases, 
the 
expansion 
was 
abrupt, 
and 
occurred 
around 
the 
time 
of 
the 
First 
World 
War. 
The 
transformation 
generated 
by 
this 
massive 
and 
sudden 
influx 
of 
new 
voters 
was 
clearly 
profound 
and 
involved 
uncharted 
political 
territory 
for 
all 
key 
actors, 
established 
or 
novices. 
This 
extraordinary 
shift 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
electorate, 
in 
turn, 
implies 
that 
the 
level 
of 
uncertainty 
for 
all 
key 
actors 
increased 
by 
several 
orders 
of 
magnitude. 


Consider 
further 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
political 
leaders 
and 
parties 
could 
gather 
information 
on 
the 
distribution 
of 
voter 
preferences 
in 
the 
obvious 
absence 
of 
any 
opinion 
polls, 
bearing 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
meaning 
of 
past 
electoral 
results 
had 
rapidly 
become 
moot. 
Since, 
as 
observed 
above, 
estimates 
of 
the 
likely 
number 
of 
parties 
competing 
in 
future 
elections 
and 
the 
likely 
effects 
of 
different 
rules 
hinge 
crucially 
on 
the 
distribution 
of 
voter 
preferences, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
major 
political 
players 
were 
operating 
with 
severely 
limited 
information. 
Further, 
electoral 
rules 
were 


1 
For 
three 
other 
cases, 
the 
big 
expansion 
came 
later: 
France 
(1945), 
Belgium 
(1949), 
and 
Switzerland 
(1971).

changed 
by 
established 
as 
well 
as 
non-established 
parties 
and 
even 
by 
voters. 
Thus, 
we 
would 
expect 
that 
in 
early 
20th 
Century 
Europe, 
just 
as 
in 
late 
20th 
Century 
Central 
and 
Eastern 
Europe, 
strategic 
calculations 
often 
became 
miscalculations, 
so 
that 
there 
are 
many 
parallels 
between 
patterns 
of 
electoral 
reform 
at 
the 
beginning 
and 
end 
of 
the 
Century. 


As 
we 
show 
below, 
a 
closer 
inspection 
of 
electoral 
choice 
in 
the 
early 
20th 
Century 
suggests 
that 
there 
was 
far 
more 
variation 
in 
the 
conditions 
of 
electoral 
choice 
across 
cases 
and 
far 
more 
uncertainty 
over 
voter 
preferences 
than 
is 
generally 
recognized. 
Moreover, 
among 
the 
set 
of 
cases 
considered 
by 
Boix 
are 
several 
in 
which 
reform 
of 
electoral 
rules 
was 
not 
on 
the 
political 
agenda, 
e.g. 
United 
States, 
Canada, 
Australia 
and 
New 
Zealand. 
Including 
these 
countries 
exaggerates 
the 
number 
of 
instances 
in 
which 
a 
single 
member 
district 
system 
was 
actively 
chosen 
by 
party 
elites. 
Once 
inappropriate 
cases 
are 
set 
aside 
(those 
outside 
Western 
Europe), 
there 
is 
only 
one 
instance 
(Britain) 
in 
which 
party 
leaders 
actually 
chose 
to 
retain 
SMDP 
rather 
than 
adopt 
PR. 
Elsewhere 
in 
Western 
Europe 
party 
elites 
chose 
some 
version 
of 
proportional 
representation. 
Given 
the 
high 
levels 
of 
uncertainty 
that 
elites 
faced 
then, 
as 
now, 
this 
is 
the 
outcome 
that 
we 
would 
have 
expected. 
The 
question 
then 
becomes 
not 
why 
some 
countries 
adopted 
PR 
while 
others 
chose 
to 
retain 
SMDP, 
but 
instead 
why 
Britain 
alone 
chose 
to 
retain 
SMDP. 


6. 
Distant 
miscalculations: 
the 
role 
of 
uncertainty 
in 
early 
20th 
Century 
Europe 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
is 
an 
especially 
important 
case 
in 
this 
respect. 
Despite 
ongoing 
proposals 
for 
electoral 
reform 
from 
the 
late 
19th 
Century 
through 
the 
early

24 
(2005) 
65–84 
1920s, 
this 
was 
the 
only 
country 
where 
electoral 
reform 
failed. 
Further, 
and 
as 
noted 
above, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
was 
unusual 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
the 
status 
quo 
involved 
a 
mostly 
single-member 
district 
plurality 
formula, 
so 
that 
the 
alternatives 
were 
cast 
in 
a 
Duverger-style 
environment. 
But 
the 
case 
is 
also 
noteworthy 
in 
the 
ways 
it 
underscores 
the 
kinds 
of 
strategic 
calculations 
made 
by 
all 
the 
key 
actors 
on 
the 
issue 
under 
uncertainty 
of 
such 
magnitude 
that 
it 
led 
to 
a 
major 
miscalculation 
for 
at 
least 
one 
party, 
and 
arguably 
for 
another. 


Since 
well 
before 
the 
last 
major 
reforms 
of 
the 
19th 
Century, 
those 
of 
1883–1885 
enacted 
by 
William 
Gladstone’s 
government, 
many 
Liberals 
had 
been 
predisposed 
to 
some 
form 
of 
PR, 
although 
these 
sympathies 
were 
subject 
to 
considerable 
qualification 
(Bogdanor, 
1981; 
Hart, 
1992). 
These 
predispositions 
were 
doubtless 
reinforced 
by 
the 
results 
of 
the 
general 
elections 
from 
1886 
through 
1900, 
where, 
despite 
receiving 
approximately 
45% 
of 
the 
vote 
each 
time, 
the 
Liberals 
received 
less 
than 
30% 
of 
the 
seats 
in 
all 
elections 
except 
for 
that 
of 
1892, 
when 
they 
won 
40.6% 
of 
the 
seats 
(Mackie 
and 
Rose, 
1991, 
Table 
24.3). 
Indeed, 
the 
figures 
for 
1900 
shown 
in 
the 
first 
row 
of 
Table 
1 
typified 
the 
Liberal 
experience, 
with 
a 
seats/votes 
ratio 
of 
just 
0.61. 
The 
figures 
for 
1900 
shown 
in 
the 
Table, 
with 
a 
seats/votes 
ratio 
of 
1.19, 
also 
exemplify 
the 
Conservative 
experience 
of 
preceding 
years, 
and 
Conservatives 
continued 
to 
be 
strong 
(if 
not 
always 
unanimous) 
in 
their 
support 
for 
existing 
electoral 
arrangements. 


Perhaps 
in 
light 
of 
their 
seats/votes 
ratios 
from 
1886 
to 
1900, 
but 
certainly 
following 
them, 
and 
in 
anticipation 
of 
an 
election 
later 
in 
the 
year 
(one 
that 
did 
not 
materialize), 
the 
Liberals 
in 
1903 
entered 
into 
a 
pact 
with 
Labour 
(secretly 
negotiated 
between 
Herbert 
Gladstone 
and 
Ramsay 
MacDonald). 
The 
agreement, 
in 
effect 
throughout 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
decade, 
enabled 
Labour 
(until 
1906 
actually 
the 
Labour 
Representation 
Committee) 
to 
field 
most 
of 
its 
candidates 
without 
any 
need 
to 
face 
Liberal 
opposition 
(Pelling, 
1961). 
In 
other 
words, 
this 
was 
a 
pact 
that 
enabled 
the 
two 
parties 
to 
coordinate 
against 
Conservatives. 


Against 
this 
backdrop, 
the 
1906 
general 
election 
must 
indeed 
have 
been 
a 
pleasant 
event 
for 
the 
Liberals. 
Although 
their 
vote 
share 
hardly 
changed 
from 
1900, 
they 
won 
by 
a 
landslide, 
picking 
up 
215 
additional 
seats 
(see 
Table 
1). 
The 
Conservative 
vote 
share 
fell 
only 
slightly 
from 
50.3 
to 
43.4% 
(while 
the 
Labour 
vote 
increased 
by 
a 
similar 
amount), 
but 
Conservatives 
lost 
a 
dramatic 
246 
seats. 
The 
pact 
thus 
worked 
especially 
well 
in 
its 
first 
trial 
for 
the 
Liberals, 
and 
as 
Hart 
wryly 
observes, 
‘‘for 
a 
time 
after 
the 
general 
election 
of 
1906 
many 
Liberals 
were 
disposed 
to 
look 
more 
charitably 
on 
the 
existing 
electoral 
system 
than 
previously’’ 
(1992, 
p. 
163). 


Labour 
benefited 
as 
well. 
Indeed, 
in 
1906 
and 
the 
two 
general 
elections 
of 
1910, 
both 
the 
Liberals 
and 
Labour 
enjoyed 
higher 
seats/votes 
ratios 
than 
did 
the 
Conservatives. 
Given 
the 
electoral 
system 
and 
Labour’s 
vote 
share, 
such 
Labour 
seats/votes 
ratios 
would 
clearly 
have 
been 
impossible 
absent 
the 
pact. 
In 
the 
1906 
election, 
the 
party 
fielded 
a 
total 
of 
just 
50 
candidates: 
of 
the 
29 
winners, 
only 
five 
had 
Liberal 
opponents, 
and 
in 
two 
of 
these 
cases 
the 
opposition 
was 
nominal. 
In 
the 
first 
1910 
election, 
no 
successful 
Labour 
candidates 
faced 
Liberal 
opposition, 
while 
in 
the 
second 
election 
of 
that 
year, 
only 
two 
Labour 
candidates 
experienced 
such 
opposition 
(Pelling, 
1961, 
pp. 
15–24). 
Even 
so, 
the 
benefit 
conferred 
on 
Labour

Note 
that, 
given 
the

in 
1918 
of 
adult 
male 
suffrage 
and 
restricted 
female 
suffrage 
(women 
over 
30 
could 
vote 
if 
they 
or 
their 
husbands 
were 
householders), 
the 
size 
of 
the 
electorate 
almost 
trebled 
from 
7.7 
million 
in 
1910 
to 
21.4 
million 
in 
1918.

the 
pact 
was 
short-term, 
since 
the 
agreement 
applied 
to 
only 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
(typically 
two-member) 
seats. 
It 
thus 
capped 
the 
party’s 
longer 
term 
aspirations 
for 
growth. 


Finally, 
observe 
that 
the 
Conservatives 
did 
poorly 
in 
the 
three 
elections 
covered 
by 
the 
pact 
between 
the 
Liberals 
and 
Labour. 
The 
coordination 
between 
the 
latter 
two 
parties 
held 
the 
Conservative 
seats/votes 
ratio 
below 
1.0 
in 
each 
case. 
Moreover, 
Table 
1 
shows 
that 
these 
three 
elections 
were 
the 
only 
instances 
between 
1900 
and 
1935 
in 
which 
this 
ratio 
was 
less 
than 
1.0. 


During 
the 
war 
years, 
the 
question 
of 
electoral 
reform 
was 
much 
discussed. 
It 
formed 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
Speaker’s 
conference 
that 
recommended 
PR, 
and 
culminated 
in 
the 
Representation 
of 
the 
People 
Act 
of 
1918 
that 
enacted 
adult 
male 
and 
limited 
female 
suffrage, 
among 
other 
things. 
The 
1918 
Act 
did 
not, 
however, 
include 
PR 
(Ogg, 
1918). 
It 
is 
useful 
to 
consider 
party 
support 
for 
PR 
in 
the 
debates 
that 
preceded 
the 
Act. 
The 
first 
three 
panels 
of 
Table 
2 
show 
the 
parliamentary 
votes 
by 
party 
on 
proposals 
that 
came 
before 
the 
Commons 
prior 
to 
the 
Act 
(MPs 
were 
given 
free 
votes 
on 
these 
questions). 


None 
of 
the 
votes 
shown 
in 
Table 
2 
reveals 
majority 
support 
for 
PR. 
Of 
more 
interest, 
perhaps, 
the 
three 
votes 
reported 
for 
1917 
and 
early 
1918 
show 
that 
Conservative 
support 
for 
the 
status 
quo 
remained 
broad-based 
and 
strong. 
At 
the 
other 
end 
of 
the 
spectrum, 
the 
small 
Irish 
Nationalist 
minority 
unanimously 
supported 
PR. 
But 
support 
for 
PR 
was 
mixed 
among 
Liberal 
and 
Labour 
MPs. 
Among 
Liberal 
members, 
this 
diversity 
of 
views 
was 
longstanding: 
although 
there 
were 
many 
reformists 
in 
the 
party, 
the 
leadership 
had 
traditionally 
been 
less 
certain 
about 
PR, 
a 
view 
undoubtedly 
reinforced 
by 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
1906 
election. 
While 
there 
was 
much 
interest 
in 
PR 
among 
the 
Labour 
rank 
and 
file, 
PR 
was 
rejected 
at 
the 
Party 
conference 
of 
1914, 
at 
the 
prodding 
of

Party’s 
chair,

In 
his 
view, 
PR 
might 
help 
Labour 
in 
the

run,

in

longer 
term 
with

for

left-wing 
vote’’ 
(Bogdanor, 
1981, 
p. 
125). 
This 
strategic 
position 
was 
also 
endorsed 
by 
the 
Fabians 
(Hart, 
1992, 
pp. 
166–167).2 


The 
1918 
election 
was 
the 
first 
to 
be 
held 
with 
nearly 
full 
adult 
suffrage. 
As 
is 
clear 
from 
Table 
1, 
the 
Conservatives 
won 
a 
clear 
majority 
of 
seats 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
just 
under 
40% 
of 
the 
popular 
vote, 
an 
outcome 
that 
simply 
reinforced 
their 
antipathy 
toward 
PR. 
With 
the 
Liberal-Labour 
electoral 
pact 
of 
1903 
no 
longer 
in 
force, 
the 
Liberals 
garnered 
a 
seats/votes 
ratio 
of 
0.86 
to 
win 
163 
seats 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
about 
27% 
of 
the 
vote. 
Thus, 
their 
seat 
losses 
compared 
to 
1910 
were 
roughly 
commensurate 
with 
their 
vote 
losses, 
and 
1918 
saw 
no 
change 
in 
the 
Liberal 
stance 
on 
PR. 
Labour 
did 
poorly: 
despite 
a 
more 
than 
trebled 
vote 
share, 
the 
party 
won 
only 
61 
seats. 


Opinion 
on 
PR 
within 
both 
the 
Liberal 
and 
Labour 
parties 
was 
to 
shift 
dramatically 
over 
the 
6 
years 
after 
1918. 
While 
the 
Conservatives 
retained 
a 
clear 
majority 
in 
1922, 
the 
election 
itself 
was 
a 
watershed: 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
Labour 
won 
more 
seats 
than 
the 
Liberals 
and 
thus 
became 
the 
principal 
opposition 
party 
(see 
Table 
1). 
In 
the 
same 
election, 
PR 
was 
included 
as 
part 
of 
the 
independent 
Liberal 
party 
manifesto, 
its 
first 
appearance 
in 
a 
party 
program 
(Hart, 
1992). 
Labour 
increased 
its 
seat 
share 
further 
in 
1923, 
with 
a 
seats/votes 
ratio 
greater 
than 
1.0 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
and 
Ramsay 
MacDonald 
formed 
a 
minority 
government 
with 
Liberal 
support. 


Six 
years 
after 
1918, 
a 
private 
member’s 
bill 
proposing 
PR 
came 
before 
the 
Commons. 
As 
the 
last 
section 
of 
Table 
2 
shows, 
Liberals 
were 
now 
(with 
the 
benefit 
of 
hindsight) 
almost 
unanimously 
in 
favor 
of 
PR. 
Offsetting 
this 
shift, 
however, 
was 


2 
An 
additional 
factor 
complicating 
the 
picture 
was 
that 
many 
members 
of 
both 
the 
Liberal 
and 
Labour 
parties 
were 
more 
interested 
in 
the 
alternative 
vote 
than 
in 
PR, 
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
it 
would 
increase 
their 
odds 
of 
success 
against 
Conservatives 
in 
constituencies 
with 
three-way 
races.

the 
alternative 
vote,

Labour 
support 
for 
the 
existing 
plurality 
system 
by 
an 
overwhelming 
three-to-one 
majority. 
By 
1924 
PR 
had 
thus 
become 
a 
partisan 
issue, 
opposed 
by 
both 
the 
Conservatives 
and 
Labour, 
and 
favored 
only 
by 
the 
Liberals. 


There 
is 
little 
in 
this 
chronology 
that 
fits 
well 
with 
the 
arguments 
advanced 
by 
either 
Rokkan 
or 
Boix. 
Labour 
became 
a 
powerful 
force 
during 
the 
1920s, 
winning 
a 
plurality 
of 
seats 
by 
1929, 
just 
11 
years 
after 
the 
introduction 
of 
adult 
suffrage. 
Despite 
this, 
there 
was 
no 
movement 
toward 
PR 
of 
the 
form 
anticipated 
by 
Rokkan. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
coordination 
among 
party 
elites 
did 
not 
involve 
an 
attempt 
by 
the 
established 
parties 
to 
collude 
against 
the 
new 
party, 
but 
instead 
centered 
on 
short 
term 
calculations 
that 
involved 
shifting 
coalitions. 
In 
the 
first 
decade 
of 
the 
20th 
Century, 
Liberals 
and 
Labour 
coordinated 
with 
their 
electoral 
agreement; 
during 
the 
First 
World 
War 
and 
shortly 
thereafter, 
Liberals 
and 
Conservatives 
coordinated 
in 
the 
coalition 
government; 
after 
1922, 
the 
Conservatives 
and 
Labour 
coordinated 
against 
the 
Liberals 
on 
the 
question 
of 
the 
plurality 
system. 


Thus, 
each 
party 
engaged 
in 
strategic 
behavior 
to 
maximize 
its 
own 
short-term 
interests. 
When 
two 
parties 
calculated 
on 
the 
information 
at 
hand 
that 
coordination 
might 
help 
advance 
their 
immediate 
discrete 
interests, 
they 
coordinated; 
otherwise, 
they 
did 
not. 
From 
the 
figures 
in 
Table 
1, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
one 
of 
the 
three 
key 
parties 
(the 
Conservatives) 
had 
made 
a 
better 
calculation 
by 
the 
mid-1920s 
than 
the 
others, 
given 
that 
the 
Conservative 
seats/votes 
ratio 
easily 
exceeded 
1.0 
throughout 
the 
1930s. 
While 
the 
results 
of 
the 
1929 
election 
might 
have 
suggested 
that 
Labour 
had 
collectively 
made 
a 
good 
choice 
in 
1924, 
their 
experiences 
in 
the 
1930s 
would 
suggest 
otherwise 
(unless 
one 
believes 
they 
were 
employing 
an 
even 
longer 
time 
horizon). 
That 
the 
Liberals 
made 
a 
mistake 
by 
not 
pushing 
for 
PR 
earlier 
may 
have 
become 
clear 
after 
the 
fact, 
but 
their 
strategy 
made 
sense 
given 
the 
information 
they 
had 
at 
the 
time. 


The 
United 
Kingdom 
is 
a 
crucial 
case 
since 
no 
form 
of 
PR 
was 
adopted, 
in 
contrast 
to 
changes 
that 
occurred 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
early 
20th 
Century 
Western 
Europe. 
Given 
the 
role 
of 
uncertainty 
in 
recent 
choices 
of 
electoral 
rules 
in 
Eastern 
Europe, 
we 
would 
expect 
to 
find 
a 
similarly 
varied 
and 
complex 
pattern 
in 
the 
other 
early 
cases 
where 
some 
form 
of 
PR 
was 
chosen. 


In 
some 
instances, 
electoral 
reform 
did 
not 
originate 
with 
established 
party 
elites. 
For 
example, 
Swiss 
electoral 
rules 
changed 
from 
a 
single 
member 
district 
two-ballot 
system 
to 
a 
proportional 
system 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
national 
referendum. 
As 
shown 
in 
Table 
3, 
the 
Radical 
Democrats 
had 
enjoyed 
comfortable 
parliamentary 
majorities 
of 
around 
60% 
of 
the 
seats 
(based 
on 
seats/votes 
ratios 
of 
about 
1.2) 
since 
the 
turn 
of 
the 
century, 
which 
they 
used 
to 
defeat 
a 
legislative 
proposal 
to 
amend 
the 
constitution 
in 
the 
summer 
of 
1918. 
The 
proposal 
was 
then 
put 
to 
a 
national 
referendum 
and 
became 
part 
of 
federal 
law 
in 
February 
1919, 
prior 
to 
the 
national 
election 
held 
later 
that 
year 
(Gosnell, 
1930; 
Carstairs, 
1980, 
p. 
141). 
Thus, 
the 
referendum 
was 
used 
in 
this 
case 
to 
circumvent 
a 
parliamentary 
majority. 


The 
German 
case 
illustrates 
another 
pattern. 
With 
the 
collapse 
of 
Imperial 
Germany 
after 
the 
First 
World 
War 
and 
the 
ensuing 
domestic 
crisis, 
the 
Kaiser 
appointed 
the 
Social 
Democratic 
leader 
as 
chancellor 
just 
before 
he 
abdicated. 
In 
one 
of 
its 
first 
actions, 
the 
new 
Social 
Democratic 
government 
adopted 
PR 
by 
executive 
fiat 
(recall 
that 
the 
German 
legislature 
did 
not 
become 
sovereign 
until 
after

Observe 
that 
PR 
was 
introduced 
by 
a 
government 
of 
the 
left, 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
British 
experience 
and 
notwithstanding 
the

(on 
these 
patterns, 
see 
Carstairs, 
1980, 
pp. 
162–165; 
Rustow,

While 
some 
have 
claimed 
that 
PR 
represented 
a 
policy 
commitment 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Social 
Democrats, 
it 
is 
also 
the 
case 
that 
they 
had 
fared 
poorly 
under 
the 
previous 
electoral 
regime. 
As 
shown 
in 
Table 
4, 
the 
average 
seats/votes 
ratio 
for 
the 
Social 
Democrats 
from 
1893 
through 
1912 
was 
about 
0.6, 
while 
the 
corresponding 
figures 
for 
the 
Conservative 
and 
Center 
Parties 
were 
about 
1.4. 


We 
could 
adduce 
other 
cases, 
but 
the 
point 
should 
be 
clear. 
There 
is 
little 
evidence 
from 
early 
20th 
Century 
Western 
Europe 
that 
PR 
was 
adopted 
by 
established 
political 
interests 
in 
an 
effort 
to 
minimize 
their 
losses 
given 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
suffrage. 
In 
the 
one 
case 
where 
electoral 
reform 
failed 
(the 
United 
Kingdom), 
it 
was 
blocked 
by 
an 
established 
party 
along 
with 
a 
newcomer. 
With 
the 
benefit 
of 
considerable 
hindsight 
the 
Liberal 
strategy 
seems 
foolish 
while 
the

of 
the

hardly 
self-evident

the 
1930s

uncertainty 
undermined 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
these 
strategic 
endeavors). 
In 
Switzerland, 
PR 
was 
introduced 
by 
referendum, 
in 
a 
move 
that 
bypassed 
the 
objections 
of 
the 
largest 
established 
party 
in 
the 
legislature. 
And 
in 
the 
singular 
circumstances 
of 
post-War 
Germany, 
a 
newcomer 
party 
(the 
Social 
Democrats) 
found 
themselves 
in 
a 
position 
where 
they 
could 
introduce 
PR 
by 
edict. 


7. 
The 
puzzle 
of 
the 
Boix 
empirical 
results 
One 
issue 
remains. 
Boix’s 
(1999) 
statistical 
estimates 
seem 
to 
challenge 
our 
emphasis 
on 
uncertainty 
since 
they 
indicate 
that 
electoral 
reform 
was 
generated 
by 
a 
predictable 
set 
of 
coalitions 
involving 
established 
political 
parties 
threatened 
by 
new 
parties 
of 
the 
left 
in 
the 
early 
20th 
Century. 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
examine 
the 
robustness 
of 
his 
estimates 
in 
some 
detail 
to 
show 
that 
the 
challenge 
is 
more 
apparent 
than 
real. 


Following 
Lijphart 
(1994) 
and 
Taagepera 
and 
Shugart 
(1989), 
Boix’s 
dependent 
variable 
is 
the 
effective 
electoral 
threshold, 
a 
measure 
that 
reflects 
the 
proportionality 
of 
the 
electoral 
system 
(the 
lower 
the 
effective 
threshold, 
the 
more 
proportional 
the 
system). 
Party 
system 
characteristics 
are 
represented 
as 
a 
joint 
function 
of 
the 
proportion 
of 
votes 
received 
by 
parties 
of 
the 
left 
and 
the 
effective 
number 
of 
established 
non-socialist 
parties. 
The 
subsidiary 
claim 
that 
electoral 
reform 
is 
a 
function 
of 
geographic 
size 
(which 
Boix 
takes 
to 
reflect 
linguistic 
and 
ethnic 
diversity) 
is 
evaluated 
using 
information 
about 
the 
geographical 
size 
of 
countries 
and 
an 
index 
of 
ethnic/linguistic 
fragmentation. 
Country 
values 
for 
these 
measures 
are 
listed 
in 
Boix 
(1999 
Appendix 
A). 


The 
first 
column 
of 
Table 
5 
reports 
the 
basic 
set 
of 
OLS 
estimates 
employed 
by 
Boix 
and 
corresponds 
to 
model 
(2) 
in 
his 
Table 
5. 
Here, 
the 
effective 
threshold 
is 
regressed 
on 
left 
party 
strength, 
old 
party 
fragmentation, 
the 
product 
of 
these 
two 
party 
variables 
(‘Threat’), 
and 
the 
geographical 
size 
of 
the 
country 
(expressed 
as 
log10 
of 
the 
area 
in 
000 
km2).3 
These 
estimates 
appear 
to 
offer 
strong 
support 
for 
Boix’s 
main 
argument. 
In 
particular, 
the 
coefficient 
for 
Threat 
is 
significant 
beyond 
the 
0.05 
level 
and 
has 
the 
correct 
negative 
sign, 
indicating 
that 
as 
the 
strength 
of 
left 
parties 
and 
the 
fragmentation 
of 
old 
parties 
jointly 
increase, 
the 
electoral 
system 
becomes 
more 
proportional.4 
Additionally, 
the 
coefficient 
on 
size 
is 
positive 
and 
highly 
significant, 
suggesting 
that 
increasing 
size 
generates 
more 
disproportionality. 
The 
overall 
fit 
of 
the 
model 
is 
respectable, 
with 
an 
adjusted 
R2 
of 
0.59. 
Given 
these 
estimates, 
‘particularly 
the 
statistical 
strength 
of 
the 
interactive 
term’, 
Boix 
concludes 
that 
‘‘threat 
is 
the 
fundamental 
factor 
in 
determining 
the 
choice 
of 
an 
electoral 
threshold’’ 
(1999, 
p. 
620). 


3 
We 
report 
OLS 
estimates 
to 
maximize 
comparability 
with 
Boix’s 
figures, 
along 
with 
Huber-White 
standard 
errors 
to 
correct 
for 
heteroskedasticity. 
These 
standard 
errors 
are 
smaller 
than 
their 
conventional 
OLS 
counterparts 
employed 
by 
Boix, 
and 
thus 
our 
use 
of 
them 
provides 
stronger 
apparent 
support 
for 
his 
model 
than 
he 
reported. 


4 
Boix 
appears 
concerned 
that 
‘‘against 
theoretical 
expectations, 
the 
coefficients 
of 
socialism 
and 
the 
effective 
number 
of 
old 
parties 
are 
positive’’ 
(1999, 
p. 
620). 
However, 
these 
signs 
are 
actually 
consistent 
with 
his 
theoretical 
expectations, 
because 
the 
two 
separate 
party 
coefficients 
cannot 
be 
evaluated 
individually 
in 
a 
multiplicative 
model 
where 
the 
effects 
of 
each 
of 
the 
party 
variables 
are 
conditional 
on 
each 
other 
(see, 
e.g. 
Friedrich, 
1982).

There 
is, 
however, 
little 
reason 
to 
take 
these 
estimates 
at 
face 
value. 
A 
striking 
feature 
of 
those 
figures 
is 
that 
the 
estimated 
coefficient 
for 
geographic 
size 
has 
a 
much 
larger 
t-ratio 
(9.67/1.60=6.05) 
than 
the 
other 
variables. 
Observe 
that 
this 
variable 
is 
geographic 
size 
(national 
acreage), 
not 
population 
size 
or 
population 
density. 
The 
question 
is, 
what 
does 
geographic 
size 
reflect? 
According 
to 
Boix, 
‘‘size 
is, 
above 
all, 
a 
proxy 
for 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
ethnic 
and 
linguistic 
fragmentation 
affects 
each 
country 
and 
the 
means 
elites 
devise 
to 
deal 
with 
it’’ 
(1999, 
p. 
620). 


Accordingly, 
he 
generates 
a 
new 
term 
that 
is 
the 
product 
of 
an 
index 
of 
ethnic/ 
linguistic 
fragmentation 
and 
a 
dummy 
variable 
that 
equals 
1 
for 
smaller 
countries, 
and 
zero 
otherwise. 
This 
new 
term 
thus 
specifies 
an 
interaction 
between 
ethnic 
diversity 
and 
population 
size. 
However, 
when 
Boix 
substitutes 
this 
new 
interaction 
term 
for 
geographic 
size, 
the 
fit 
of 
the 
model 
is 
almost 
halved: 
the 
adjusted 
R2 
in 
column 
3 
of 
his 
Table 
1 
is 
0.33, 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
adjusted 
R2 
of 
0.59 
in 
column 
2 
of 
his 
Table 
5 
(or 
column 
1 
of 
our 
Table 
5). 
In 
this 
sense, 
substituting 
information 
about 
ethnic 
and 
linguistic 
fragmentation 
for 
geographic 
size 
actually 
diminishes 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
model. 
Further, 
as 
shown 
in 
the 
estimates 
in 
the 
second 
column 
of 
our 
Table 
5, 
when 
geographic 
size 
and 
the 
ethnolinguistic-size 
interaction 
are 
included 
in 
the 
same 
model, 
the 
estimate 
for 
the 
latter 
is 
much 
smaller 
than 
its 
standard 
error 
while 
the 
coefficient 
for 
geographic 
size 
does 
not 
shift, 
and 
the 
model 
fit 
is 
not 
improved. 
This 
means 
that 
geographic 
size 
cannot 
be 
taken 
as 
a 
proxy 
for 
ethnic-linguistic 
fragmentation.5 
For 
better 
or 
for 
worse, 
and 
consistent 
with 
Blais 
and 
Massicotte 
(1997), 
size 
is 
clearly 
the 
key 
factor 
at 
work, 
and 
the 
size/ 
fragmentation 
interaction 
does 
not 
belong 
in 
the 
analysis. 
Clearly, 
there 
is 
no

Boix 
(1999, 
p. 
620) 
uses 
the 
same 
test 
to 
conclude 
that 
geographic 
size 
is 
not 
a 
proxy 
for 
trade 
openness.

support 
in 
these 
data 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
country 
size 
as 
a 
proxy 
for 
ethnic/linguistic 
fragmentation. 


We 
are, 
indeed, 
at 
a 
loss 
to 
identify 
the 
mechanism 
by 
which 
geographic 
size 
might 
plausibly 
be 
said 
to 
impinge 
on 
the 
electoral 
threshold. 
Further 
analyses, 
not 
displayed 
here, 
indicate 
that 
it 
is 
not 
serving 
as 
a 
proxy 
for 
population 
size 
or 
for 
population 
density. 
Acreage 
alone 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
thing, 
a 
regularity 
that 
is 
difficult 
to 
explain. 


At 
the 
same 
time, 
sheer 
geographic 
size 
does 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
Boix’s 
empirical 
analysis. 
Observe 
the 
estimates 
in 
column 
3 
of 
Table 
5, 
which 
correspond 
to 
those 
in 
the 
first 
and 
third 
columns, 
except 
that 
they 
do 
not 
include 
either 
of 
the 
country 
size 
terms. 
Here 
we 
see 
that 
when 
considered 
by 
themselves, 
neither 
of 
the 
two 
individual 
party 
terms 
nor 
their 
product 
has 
a 
systematic 
effect 
on 
the 
size 
of 
the 
effective 
threshold. 
Indeed, 
compared 
with 
the 
figures 
in 
column 
1, 
the 
fit 
of 
the 
model 
in 
column 
3 
plummets 
(the 
adjusted 
R2 
drops 
from 
0.59 
to 
0.17), 
and 
the 
estimated 
Threat 
coefficient 
in 
column 
3 
is 
appreciably 
smaller 
than 
that 
shown 
in 
column 
1. 
The 
inclusion 
of 
country 
size 
is 
thus 
crucial 
to 
Boix’s 
analysis 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
it 
drives 
his 
statistical 
estimates. 
With 
this 
variable 
excluded, 
there 
is 
little 
basis 
for 
his 
principal 
claim, 
noted 
above, 
that 
‘‘threat 
is 
the 
fundamental 
factor 
in 
determining 
the 
choice 
of 
an 
electoral 
threshold’’.6 
More 
broadly, 
this 
means 
that 
there 
is 
no 
basis 
for 
the 
claim 
that 
electoral 
reform 
was 
generated 
by 
a 
predictable 
set 
of 
coalitions 
involving 
established 
political 
parties 
threatened 
by 
emerging 
parties 
of 
the 
left 
in 
the 
early 
20th 
Century. 


8. 
A 
simpler 
formulation 
Consider 
now 
a 
much 
simpler 
model 
of 
electoral 
rule 
choice, 
one 
that 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
impact 
of 
extreme 
uncertainty. 
Our 
reanalysis 
of 
Boix’s 
statistical 
results 
reinforces 
our 
view 
that 
long-term 
coordination 
among 
established 
parties 
is 
unlikely 
in 
an 
uncertain 
environment. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
to 
say 
that 
the 
strategic 
capabilities 
of 
all 
parties 
involved, 
whether 
established 
or 
emerging, 
is 
limited 
by 
a 
general 
lack 
of 
information 
is 
not 
to 
preclude 
strategic 
calculations. 


Accordingly, 
we 
posit 
a 
model 
based 
on 
the 
simplest 
kind 
of 
strategic, 
seat-
maximizing 
behavior 
possible: 
all 
parties 
base 
their 
support 
or 
opposition 
to 
a 
change 
in 
electoral 
rules 
in 
light 
of 
their 
performance 
(as 
manifested 
in 
their 
seats/ 
votes 
ratios) 
under 
current 
rules 
in 
the 
previous 
election. 
Observe 
that 
this 
involves 
short-term 
calculations, 
since 
we 
expect 
longer-term 
calculations 
to 
be 
shrouded 
in 
even 
more 
uncertainty. 
We 
hypothesize 
that 
as 
the 
ratio 
of 
seats 
to 
votes 
for 
the 
largest 
party 
increases, 
that 
party’s 
support 
for 
an 
electoral 
system 
with 
a 
high 
electoral 
threshold 
(such 
as 
an 
SMDP 
system) 
also 
increases, 
whether 
or 
not 
that 
party 
is 
old 
and 
established 
or 
new. 
By 
the 
same 
token, 
as 
the 
seats/votes 
ratio 
of 
the 
largest 
party 
decreases, 
that 
party’s 
support 
for 
an 
electoral 
system 
with 
a 
low 
electoral 
threshold 
(such 
as 
some 
form 
of 
PR) 
should 
increase, 
regardless 
of 
its 


6 
We 
emphasize 
that 
it 
is 
geographic 
size, 
not 
the 
size/fragmentation 
interaction, 
that 
is 
crucial 
here.

ideological 
composition. 
Implicit 
in 
this 
formulation 
is 
the 
proposition 
that 
the 
largest 
party 
in 
parliament 
has 
the 
most 
influence 
on 
any 
decision 
to 
change 
the 
electoral 
rules. 


Observe 
that 
this 
formulation 
is 
consistent 
with 
Benoit 
(2004) 
and 
also 
runs 
through 
our 
earlier 
analyses 
of 
particular 
cases. 
Barring 
the 
three 
elections 
in 
which 
they 
faced 
strategically 
coordinated 
behavior 
from 
their 
opponents, 
the 
British 
Conservatives 
enjoyed 
seats/votes 
ratios 
in 
excess 
of 
1.0 
from 
1900 
through 
1935, 
and 
they 
strongly 
opposed 
any 
rule 
change. 
The 
Swiss 
Radical 
Democrats 
enjoyed 
similarly 
high 
ratios 
from 
1902 
through 
1917, 
so 
that 
reform 
came 
over 
their 
objections 
by 
means 
of 
a 
national 
referendum. 
And 
the 
German 
Social 
Democrats 
introduced 
PR 
on 
achieving 
office 
after 
the 
Kaiser’s 
abdication, 
having 
experienced 
seats/votes 
ratios 
of 
less 
than 
1.0 
in 
each 
of 
the 
five 
previous 
elections 
in 
which 
they 
had 
participated. 


In 
Table 
6, 
we 
display 
estimates 
for 
a 
model 
of 
electoral 
rule 
choice 
given 
the 
seats/votes 
ratio 
of 
the 
largest 
party 
in 
parliament, 
whether 
that 
party 
was 
an 
established 
conservative 
party 
or 
a 
new 
socialist 
or 
social 
democratic 
party 
(as 
was 
the 
case 
in 
six 
of 
the 
twenty 
countries 
included 
in 
the 
analysis). 
Focusing 
solely 
on 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
rules 
in 
the 
pre-WWII 
period, 
we 
use 
twenty 
of 
Boix’s 
original 
twenty-two 
cases. 
We 
exclude 
Spain 
and 
Greece 
on 
the 
following 
grounds. 
Spain’s 
inter-war 
democratic 
period 
lasted 
only 
5 
years 
and 
ended 
in 
a 
military 
dictatorship. 
Greece’s 
inter-war 
democratic 
period 
lasted 
a 
little 
longer 
(10 
years) 
but 
also 
ended 
in 
a 
military 
dictatorship. 
Moreover, 
Greek 
electoral 
rules 
were 
highly 
fluid 
during 
this 
period.7 
Thus, 
for 
this 
case, 
analyses 
are 
highly 
sensitive 
to 
the 
choice 
of 
election 
from 
which 
to 
start 
one’s 
analysis. 


7 
The 
extreme 
volatility 
of 
Greek 
electoral 
law 
in 
the 
inter-war 
years 
is 
shown 
in 
Boix 
(1999, 
Fig. 
7).

of 
the 
shifts 
involved,

(2005) 
65–84 
The 
estimates 
shown 
in 
Table 
6 
are 
consistent 
with 
our 
hypothesis. 
Specifically, 
as 
shown 
in 
the 
first 
column, 
the 
seats/votes 
ratio 
of 
the 
largest 
party 
in 
parliament 
has 
a 
significant 
and 
positive 
effect 
on 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
system 
(as 
measured 
by 
the 
electoral 
threshold, 
following 
Boix). 
Further, 
as 
one 
can 
see 
by 
comparing 
the 
first 
two 
columns 
in 
the 
table, 
this 
effect 
of 
the 
seats/votes 
ratio 
of 
the 
largest 
party 
does 
not 
hinge 
on 
the 
inclusion 
of 
a 
variable 
measuring 
the 
geographic 
size 
of 
our 
country 
cases. 
In 
this 
sense, 
the 
effect 
is 
more 
robust 
than 
those 
reported 
by 
Boix. 
Finally, 
the 
third 
column 
of 
Table 
6 
shows 
that 
our 
simple 
explanation 
is 
robust 
to 
the 
inclusion 
of 
the 
three 
main 
explanatory 
variables 
from 
Boix’s 
argument, 
‘threat’, 
‘size 
of 
the 
largest 
left 
party’, 
and 
‘effective 
number 
of 
old 
parties’. 
In 
other 
words, 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
our 
key 
explanatory 
variable 
and 
absent 
the 
irrelevant 
influence 
of 
geographic 
size, 
Boix’s 
key 
variables 
do 
not 
systematically 
influence 
the 
electoral 
threshold. 


Given 
the 
level 
of 
uncertainty 
involved 
in 
changing 
electoral 
rules, 
we 
would 
expect 
the 
seats/votes 
ratio 
of 
the 
largest 
party 
to 
have 
a 
systematic 
effect 
on 
the 
electoral 
threshold. 
That 
parties’ 
support 
for 
a 
new 
set 
of 
electoral 
rules 
hinges 
systematically 
on 
how 
they 
have 
recently 
performed 
under 
the 
existing 
procedure 
seems 
about 
the 
best 
that 
they 
can 
do, 
and 
it 
is 
a 
result 
in 
keeping 
with 
recent 
analyses 
of 
rule 
choice 
in 
emerging 
democracies. 
Thus, 
an 
explanation 
that 
demands 
much 
less 
on 
the 
part 
of 
party 
elites 
performs 
better 
than 
an 
explanation 
that 
assumes 
the 
availability 
of 
sufficient 
information 
to 
support 
complex 
strategic 
coordination. 


These 
results 
imply 
that 
the 
sole 
occasion 
one 
would 
expect 
a 
country 
to 
retain 
a 
single 
member 
district 
system 
is 
when 
the 
largest 
party 
benefits 
substantially 
from 
the 
current 
electoral 
rules, 
so 
much 
so 
that 
it 
can 
control 
or 
dominate 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
rules. 
This 
was 
the 
case 
only 
in 
Britain 
(see 
the 
last 
column 
of 
Table 
1 
above); 
hence, 
it 
alone 
among 
West 
European 
democracies 
chose 
to 
retain 
SMDP. 
Thus, 
our 
results 
are 
broadly 
compatible 
with 
the 
empirical 
preponderance 
of 
PR 
as 
reported 
by 
Cox 
(1997); 
further, 
our 
estimates 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
predictions 
of 
Shvetsova’s 
model 
(2003).

Conclusion 
The 
proposition 
that 
reform 
of 
electoral 
systems 
in 
early 
20th 
Century 
Western 
Europe 
was 
driven 
by 
a 
distinctive 
set 
of 
forces 
has 
a 
long 
pedigree 
originating 
with 
Rokkan’s 
(1970) 
classic 
treatment 
and 
manifested 
most 
recently 
in 
Boix’s 
(1999) 
empirical 
analysis. 
We 
agree 
with 
these 
accounts 
that 
party 
leaders 
in 
the 
period 
attempted 
to 
behave 
strategically. 
What 
is 
not 
clear, 
however, 
is 
how 
they 
could 
do 
so 
effectively 
given 
the 
extreme 
uncertainty 
they 
confronted. 
Further, 
we 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
statistical 
evidence 
for 
the 
Rokkan-Boix 
argument 
is 
not 
robust. 
We 
have 
also 
shown 
that 
a 
model 
employing 
a 
much 
simpler 
decision 
rule 
is 
more 
consistent 
with 
the 
available 
data. 
In 
our 
view, 
when 
uncertainty 
is 
taken 
seriously, 
the 
early 
period 
of 
electoral 
reform 
closely 
parallels 
the 
more 
recent 
experience 
in 
Central 
and 
Eastern 
Europe, 
obviating 
the 
need 
to 
treat 
the 
first 
period 
as 
distinctive.

(2005) 
65–84 
In 
his 
‘Comment 
on 
Institutional 
Change’, 
Shepsle 
(2001) 
casts 
institutional 
reform 
as 
a 
‘multi-dimensional’ 
game 
that 
involves 
many 
players, 
many 
possible 
outcomes, 
and 
many 
different 
participants. 
He 
concludes 
that, 
as 
a 
result, 
‘it 
comes 
down 
to 
information’ 
(pp. 
324–325). 
That 
is, 
the 
ability 
of 
key 
actors 
to 
change 
the 
rules 
to 
benefit 
themselves 
is 
limited 
by 
the 
information 
they 
have 
on 
all 
relevant 
dimensions. 
As 
we 
have 
emphasized, 
periods 
of 
electoral 
reform 
typically 
occur 
as 
a 
component 
of 
larger 
political 
transformations 
in 
which 
uncertainty 
becomes 
endemic. 
Accordingly, 
designers 
of 
electoral 
systems 
have 
historically 
not 
had 
access 
to 
the 
information 
necessary 
for 
them 
effectively 
to 
choose 
electoral 
rules 
from 
which 
they 
would 
benefit. 
During 
periods 
of 
major 
political 
transformation, 
political 
parties 
come 
and 
go, 
voter 
preferences 
change 
often 
and 
rapidly, 
and 
complex 
electoral 
rules 
along 
with 
their 
consequences 
are 
poorly 
understood. 
Thus, 
any 
effort 
to 
explain 
the 
choice 
of 
electoral 
rules 
as 
a 
predictable 
strategic 
response 
to 
electoral 
threat 
by 
a 
stable 
set 
of 
actors 
(established 
parties) 
must 
be 
viewed 
with 
skepticism. 
As 
we 
have 
shown 
in 
our 
discussion 
of 
the 
cases, 
electoral 
rules 
were 
changed 
by 
both 
established 
and 
new 
parties 
in 
both 
periods 
of 
electoral 
reform. 
Further, 
our 
systematic 
analyses 
of 
data 
from 
the 
early 
20th 
century 
suggests 
that 
political 
elites 
engaged 
in 
only 
short-term 
strategic 
behavior; 
that 
is, 
their 
support 
for 
any 
electoral 
system 
depended 
on 
how 
well 
they 
had 
fared 
in 
the 
previous 
election. 
Even 
so, 
uncertainty 
made 
it 
difficult 
(or 
even 
impossible) 
for 
party 
elites 
in 
either 
period 
to 
realize 
the 
gains 
they 
anticipated 
from 
their 
strategic 
choices.
